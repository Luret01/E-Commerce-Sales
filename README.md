**Discussion of Results & Implications**

The analysis reveals a mixed performance across different business areas. While profit margins have improved, overall sales and quantity sold have declined, indicating a potential pricing or demand issue. Regional performance disparities suggest market penetration challenges in some states. Additionally, while Standard-Class shipping is the most utilized, businesses could evaluate customer preferences for faster shipping options to enhance the shopping experience.

These insights underscore the need for strategic improvements in product offerings, regional marketing, and logistics optimization to drive revenue growth and customer satisfaction.

**5. RECOMMENDATIONS**

* Expand marketing efforts in the Central region to improve underperformance.

* Optimize product pricing to address declining sales trends.

* Introduce targeted discounts and loyalty programs for office supplies.

* Enhance logistics strategies by improving shipping time for high-value customers.

* Consider discontinuing or repositioning low-performing products.
